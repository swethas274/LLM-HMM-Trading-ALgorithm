# LLM-HMM Trading Algorithm 🚀📈

## 📌 Overview
This is an **ongoing project** focused on building a **hybrid trading algorithm** that integrates:
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for sentiment analysis from news and social media 📰
- **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** for market regime detection 📊

By combining **quantitative price modeling** with **qualitative sentiment analysis**, the algorithm aims to improve trade decision-making in volatile markets.

## ⚡ Project Status
🚧 **Under Development** – We are actively researching, testing, and optimizing the model. Stay tuned for updates!

## 🎯 Planned Features
✅ Sentiment extraction from financial news using LLMs
✅ Market regime classification using HMMs
✅ Trading strategy based on hybrid predictions
🔄 Backtesting with historical market data
📊 Visualization of sentiment and market trends

## 🔧 Getting Started (Coming Soon)
Once the initial implementation is ready, we will provide setup instructions and sample code.

## 🤝 Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, or suggest improvements.

## 📜 License
This project will be released under an open-source license upon completion.
